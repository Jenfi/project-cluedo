## Cluedo project

The focus on this project is to practice objects and arrays and also to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript. 
- Site should have three clickable cards and one clickable button.
- The clickable cards should randomly show suspects, weapons and rooms.
-  User should be able to reveal the mystery.

## Techniques and tools used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, random-function in javascript.

## My process:

I started out making all needed pbjects for th different codes, and then mounting them to the DOM. I did most of the CSS before adding the function of the reveal-button. 

If I had more  time I would adapt the size of the background picture, it is quite big making it load slow. I would have added some animation styling to the cards, making them look like they flipped, and to the button to make it look like it is being pushed down. I would also have made the site responsive.
